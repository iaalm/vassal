=== Mat

Mats are generally larger pieces that are designed to have smaller pieces (<<MatCargo.adoc#top,Mat Cargo>>) placed on top of them, and for the
cargo pieces to move along with the Mat and maintain their relative position.

When a <<GamePiece.adoc#top,Game Piece>> with this trait is selected by left-clicking on it, any game pieces with the <<MatCargo.adoc#top,Mat Cargo>>
trait that have been placed on top of the Mat piece will also become selected automatically. Therefore, if the Mat game
piece is then moved with a drag-and-drop, the cargo pieces conveniently move along with it and maintain their relative
positions.

Similarly, when a Mat piece is moved with a <<SendToLocation.adoc#top,Send to Location>> trait or a <<Translate.adoc#top,Move Fixed Distance>> trait, cargo pieces on top
of it will follow.

**WARNING:** Mats cannot be made to stack (they are always inherently <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does Not Stack>>), and cannot be placed in <<Deck.adoc#top,Decks>> if they contain any cargo.

If a Mat piece is <<Rotate.adoc#top,rotated>> or <<Pivot.adoc#top,pivoted>>, any cargo pieces on top can also match their facing to the Mat, if that option is
selected in the Mat Cargo trait.

==== Mats & Cargo - Layers and Draw Order
A Mat and its Mat Cargo, if set to the same <<GamePieceLayers.adoc#top,Game Piece Layer>>, when moved will automatically
be processed in an order such that the Mat Cargo pieces will remain "on top" of the Mat, visually. Mat Cargo pieces in higher
Game Piece Layers will likewise of course always be drawn in front.

A Mat Cargo placed in a _lower_ layer will appear to be _beneath_ the Mat when it is drawn. This can be useful for e.g.
"tucking cards underneath a Mat" -- the Mat Cargo will still stay attached to the Mat and will still move with it when the Mat
is dragged or moved. **Warning:** This scheme _can_ produce a situation wherein a Mat Cargo piece is inadvertently placed _entirely_
behind the Mat, and in this case simply "moving the Mat out of the way" isn't easy because the Mat Cargo will automatically
maintain its same relative position! The only way to recover from such a situation is to select the Mat (which automatically selects
all of its Mat Cargo), then _Ctrl+Click_ (_Command+Click_ on Mac) to unselect the Mat while leaving at least one visible Mat Cargo
selected. Then, dragging the still-selected Mat Cargo away will also produce the hidden piece, as it is still part of the selection.
A module which wants to detect this situation and remedy it by automatically moving the Mat Cargo elsewhere can attempt to detect it
through the use of the _CurrentMatOffsetX_ and _CurrentMatOffsetY_ properties of a Mat Cargo piece, combined with the
apply-on-move key command of a Map.

*Mat name:*:: An identifier for the Mat. This is exposed to the module via the _MatName_ property, and is also used when
filling the _CurrentMat_ property of <<MatCargo.adoc#top,Mat Cargo>> pieces.

*Description:*:: Description of the trait - displayed only in the Editor, in the piece definer dialog.

==== Properties

A Mat trait exposes the following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>:

* _MatName_ contains the name of the Mat, taken from the _Mat Name_ field.

* _MatID_ contains a unique identifying string for the Mat piece: even two pieces sharing the same Mat Name will have different Mat ID's.

* _MatNumCargo_ contains the number of Mat Cargo pieces currently sitting on this mat.
