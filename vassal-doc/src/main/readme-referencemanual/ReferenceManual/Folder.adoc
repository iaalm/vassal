=== Folder

Folders can be created under many components to group together similar sub-components. For example, you can create Folders under the _Global Properties_ component to organise sets of Properties, or under the _Prototype Definitions_ to organise your prototypes.

Folders can be nested to any depth and are transparent to Vassal. Whatever is stored in a Folder, is seen as stored under the top-level component that contains the nest of Folders.
